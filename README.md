# discussion-form-MERN-Stack--project
Disfo is a discussion forum where user can interact on a frontend. Users can register and sign in. After Signing in users can fetch the discussions, create a discussion, update and delete them. Users can also comment on the discussion.
In this project we have used authentication and authorization using JWT Token and also used Passport JWT library to secure our login such that the user credentials are encrypted on the frontend and cannot be compromised.
